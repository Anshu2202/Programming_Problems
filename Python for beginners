This is your first programme of python
if you want to print hello 
then you should call a function
which name is print()
and you should pass the value.

The print() function prints the specified message to the screen, or other standard output device.
The message can be a string, or any other object,
the object will be converted into a string before written to the screen.

                  print("hello")
                 
it has been done .
this is quite easy syntax .
